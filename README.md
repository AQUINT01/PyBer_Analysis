# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis
You are to utilize your Python skills and knowledge of Pandas to create a summary DataFrame of a ride-sharing company's data by city type and provide a supporting visual graph of total weekly fares for each city type.  


## Results
From the analysis, it becomes clear there was a  great disparity in fares between the three city types from January to April 2019. Urban regions experienced the greatest number of rides (1,625),  equalling to the highest revenue from fares, $39,854. However, urban-drivers received an *average fare* of just **$16.57**, that's 334.7% less than rural-drivers who made, **$55.49**.  In conclusion,  rural-drivers on average made more than urban-drivers, thus earning a greater portion of the fares collected per ride between January thru April 2019.

The graph below illustrates the fare differences between the city types with rural and urban having the widest gap, understandly so due to urban having the most rider-ship. It's evident, all three regions experience a higher ride rate between late-February and early-March. Factors for this increase can be many but one can speculate the change in season is one.  However, this momentum is not sustain for too long and all three city types level off.

## Summary
Undoubtably there is a demand for the services PyBer is providing to all three city types. A concern is the urban region's bottomline.  When looking at the data closer, it's clear the urban region was saturated with drivers versus the demand for rides, **2,405** vs **1,625**.  In simple economic terms, there wasn't enough demand for the large fleet of drivers.  To address this problem, listed below are a few recommandations PyBer can implement.

### Recommendations
-   Decrease its Driver force by more than 50% to be more in balance with demand. Having 2,405 drivers for 1,625 rides drove down average fare for both Ride and per Driver
-   Provide discount fares or incentive programs during low-seasons to increase rides
-   Offer short to long term membership contracts to business clientele or other segments 
-   Partner with local hospitals, hotels, and/or restaurants to expand markets
